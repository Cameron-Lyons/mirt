Dynamic knowledge models
========================

Bayesian knowledge tracing models a separate hidden mastery state for each
skill. Trials may be blocked by skill or interleaved in any order; inference
links only successive opportunities for the same skill.

Per-skill mastery
-----------------

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   from mirt.models import BKTModel

   model = BKTModel(
       n_skills=3,
       skill_names=["fractions", "decimals", "ratios"],
   )
   responses = np.array([1, 0, 1, -1, 1, 0])
   skills = np.array([0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2])

   mastery = model.predict_mastery_by_skill(responses, skills)
   print(dict(zip(model.skill_names, mastery)))

Responses use ``1`` for correct, ``0`` for incorrect, and ``-1`` for missing.
A missing response contributes no response evidence while preserving the trial's
place in its skill sequence.

Batch inference
---------------

For a response matrix, calculate all learners' per-skill mastery estimates in
one call:

.. code-block:: python

   response_matrix = np.array(
       [
           [1, 0, 1, -1, 1, 0],
           [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
       ]
   )
   mastery = model.predict_mastery_batch(response_matrix, skills)
   print(mastery.shape)  # (2, 3)

   posterior, log_likelihoods = model.forward_backward_batch(
       response_matrix,
       skills,
   )
   print(posterior.shape)  # (2, 6, 2)

``skill_assignments`` may also be a matrix matching the response matrix when
learners receive different trial layouts. Shared layouts use the compiled
parallel implementation when it is available. Set ``use_rust=False`` on
``BKTModel`` or ``BKTGibbsSampler`` to select the NumPy implementation for a
specific workflow; the global ``mirt.set_backend("numpy")`` preference is also
honored.

Simulation
----------

Use ``simulate`` to generate reproducible responses, skill assignments, and
latent mastery states:

.. code-block:: python

   responses, skills, states = model.simulate(
       n_persons=1_000,
       n_trials_per_skill=20,
       seed=42,
   )
